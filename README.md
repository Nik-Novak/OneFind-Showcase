# OneFind-Showcase

OneFind is a product aggregation engine that allows consumers to simultaneously search dozens of marketplaces for the products they want, saving them time and money. Not only is it extremely accessible and easy to use (while not sacrificing complexity), but we've been approved for ChatGPT's plugin beta program, which allows us to integrate natively into ChatGPT and offer an easy ideal intuitive experience for the user. This also allows us to leverage the over 100 million users (60m daily users as of April 2023) as an onramp for our platform and for simple growth exposure.

OneFind unfortunately must remain a private repo.
